# Nonlinear 

## Setup

Start here and familiarize yourself with the tools we will be using:


Github: https://github.com/join

(Note: Github now has a dropbox style drag and drop upload feature. There is also an online editor for creating or changing text files. No software or terminal commands needed.)


Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb


Lab Report: https://www.overleaf.com/read/qpfrmtfdjvbp


Lab Presentation: https://www.overleaf.com/read/xhsvcwnrkzns

## General Lab Format

For each Lab the following will be submitted the following week to your Github:

1) Commented and Documented Colab Notebook (Upload .ipynb)
2) Written Lab Report Typed in Latex
3) Report Reformatted into Presentation Slides

### Why Python?
From: https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/intro.html#why-python
* Get data (simulation, experiment control),
* Manipulate and process data,
* Visualize results, quickly to understand, but also with high quality figures, for reports or publications.

Python’s strengths
* Batteries included - Rich collection of already existing bricks of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools. We don’t want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don’t reinvent the wheel!
* Easy to learn - Most scientists are not payed as programmers, neither have they been trained so. They need to be able to draw a curve, smooth a signal, do a Fourier transform in a few minutes.
* Easy communication - To keep code alive within a lab or a company it should be as readable as a book by collaborators, students, or maybe customers. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.
* Efficient code - Python numerical modules are computationally efficient. But needless to say that a very fast code becomes useless if too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development times and quick execution times.
* Universal - Python is a language used for many different problems. Learning Python avoids learning a new software for each new problem.



Please read Python Notes 1 and the first two pages of Python Notes 2.
Prepare a new Colab Notebook and copy all of the code from the python notes files. Run and document all the code in your new Colab notebook.
Think of your notebook as a quick access cheat sheet / recipe guide.

## Lab 2 

Islands in the Sea of Complexity

"To appreciate the nature of fractals, recall Galileo’s splendid manifesto that
”Philosophy is written in the language of mathematics and its characters are
triangles, circles and other geometric figures, without which one wanders about
in a dark labyrinth.” Observe that circles, ellipses, and parabolas are very
smooth shapes and that a triangle has a small number of points of irregularity.
Galileo was absolutely right to assert that in science those shapes are necessary.
But they have turned out not to be sufficient, ”merely” because most of the
world is of infinitely great roughness and complexity. However, the infinite
sea of complexity includes two islands: one of Euclidean simplicity, and also a
second of relative simplicity in which roughness is present, but is the same at
all scales." - A Theory of Roughness, B. Mandelbrot

Comment as much of the code as you can, it is ok if you don't understand all of the pieces. Use the overleaf templates to create a new lab report and a new beamer presentation. Add the output images, code, and commentary from the notebook to each overleaf document.
