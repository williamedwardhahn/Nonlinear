## Differential Analyzer
Bush, Vannevar.
The differential analyzer. A new machine for solving differential equations
FIRST EDITION of the first report of Vannevar Bush’s differential analyzer. A remarkable technological feat, Bush’s invention was the most powerful computing machine prior to the electronic digital computer.

“In 1930, an engineer named Vannevar Bush at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed the first modern analog computer. The Differential Analyzer, as he called it, was an analog calculator that could be used to solve certain classes of differential equations... Utilizing a complicated arrangement of gears and cams driven by steel shafts, the Differential Analyzer could obtain practical (albeit approximate) solutions to problems which up to that point had been prohibitively difficult. The Differential Analyzer was a great success; it and various copies located at other laboratories were soon employed in solving diverse engineering and physics problems” (Britannica). The differential analyzer became a crucial step in the development of the modern computer.
